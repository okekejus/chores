# Chores ðŸ§¹
I currently live in a house with two other people. Between our schedules and general forgetfulness, it gets hard to coordinate who has cleaned what, or when it was cleaned. Our solution to this was a "chore chart", which is - you guessed it - a chart on the wall listing our chores, names, and dates. 

It works fine, but presents a fun use case for specific libraries in python, so I thought I'd try to automate/simplify the process. 

## Setup 
First I created a Google Sheet, and manually entered the tasks assigned to each roommate for that week - to be used as a baseline for the next steps in the process. The structure of the table is as follows: 

| Date          | PERSON 1      | PERSON 2      | PERSON 3      |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| April 20 2025  | Task         |Task         |Task         |


I imported the necessary modules using the following block of code: 
```
import pandas as pd # DataFrame manipulation
import os.path # accessing token file/credentials 
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request # sending requests to server
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials # working with API token
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow # handling client credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build # building request container/service
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError # API Error handling
from itertools import permutations # creating combinations for task assignment 
from random import randrange # selection of random indexes 
import datetime as dt
import smtplib # emails 
from email.message import EmailMessage # emails
```

## Fetching Data
The Google Sheets API documentation included instructions on fetching sheets using the sheet ID. I made slight modifications to the code + placed it in a function `get_past_week()` which grabs the data from its source. The function returns each row as a list, then places those lists within a list. As a result, creating a dataframe makes the header columns into the first row of the dataset. My remedy to this issue was the `first_row_header()` function, which takes the contents of the first row + makes them into the column names for the dataframe. 


## Determining Task Order
Next, using the `next_task_set()` function, I create a permutation based on the three available "Tasks" which refer to the grouping of areas in the house that need cleaning: Kitchen, Landing, Dining. The permutation from the most recent entry is then excluded from the possible options. A random integer between 0 - `len(list_of_permutations)` is generated using `randrange`. This integer is used to determine which of the permutations will be used in the next week. 

## Notifications 
Each roommate's name + email is stored in a list. This list is used within the function `email_tasks(contact_info, sender, roomies)`, which does as its name suggests: emails each roommate with their respective task for the week. 

# Maintenance + Next Steps 
I have set the script up to run locally using cron jobs on my personal desktop.
